* Users registration & login (powered by Google Firebase Authentication APIs)
* Users reviews
* Email notifications
* Saving on DB personal data such as page read for each book, books read, etc.
* Decent user profile page
* Follow - Following users logic
* Docker infrastructure

## Next features
* No additional features expected

## Minimum Requirements
* Docker 
* Docker Swarm
* Docker Compose (if Docker version does not include Docker Compose)
## Installation

### Start RabbitMQ instance
Before to start every other component is necessary to start RabbitMQ container instance.
In order to do that execute:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.[dev/prod].yml --project-name=mevn_books up --build -d rabbitmq
```

If it is the first start, the docker script will creates queues, users, etc so it will take a while before to be completed started.
The RabbitMQ container in DEV will expose the port ```5672``` for the connection with external connection and ```15672``` to access at management UI.
In production environment all ports are closed.

### Start backend
Before to run the project, go inside backend/book/.env file and change the
Google Books API key with yours.

#### Development
You can run every service on local using the following command inside the
service directory (not recommended):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
$ npm run dev
```
You can also (recommended) use Docker dev/local infrastructure by launching:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --project-name=mevn_books up --build -d [service name]
```
There isn't a dedicated web server and by default the gateway service listen on port ```8080```, the other services are hidden behind it and they are not
accessible directly.
#### Production
Go to Docker directory and execute:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --project-name=mevn_books up --build -d [service name]
```
The Dockerfile in this case will execute the command ```npm run build``` and than
copy the distribution directory to be served using NGINX web server.
By default the gateway listen on port ```8080```, the other services are hidden behind it and they are not accessible directly.
### Start frontend
First thing first, go to ```fronted/config``` and taking the file ```firebase_sample.js``` as example, create a new one named ```firebase.js```
with inside the Firebase API configs taken from Firebase Console.

Now you can start the frontend client by typing:

#### Development
For local purpose w/o Docker
```bash
#!/bin/bash
$ npm serve # Watchout for VueJS version installed in your machine 
```
For local purpose w/ Docker
```bash
#!/bin/bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --project-name=mevn_books up --build -d frontend
```
With this configuration you can continue to develop on local and the containers
will update every time you save because of the volumes.
By default the frontend listen on port ```8081```.
#### Production
Go to Docker directory and execute:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --project-name=mevn_books up --build -d frontend
```
The Dockerfile in this case will execute the command ```npm run build``` and
than copy the distribution directory to be served using NGINX web server.
By default the frontend listen on port ```8000```.
